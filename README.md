In 2023, I participated in numerous contests, produced many works in class, and alongside my academic pursuits, I transformed some of my research findings into conference papers for publication.

Reflection: For me, 2023 marked a turning point in my life, transitioning from a clueless undergraduate to a graduate student specializing in computer science research. 
This year brought me abundant rewards, and I sincerely thank *the teachers* and *peers* I encountered in university. 
It is through their support and joint efforts that I have achieved what I have today.
